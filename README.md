## Smoke Break

Smoke Break is a new app for iOS (at the moment) that enables you to calculate the most evenly spaced out times for you to take your smoke breaks. You'll be notified once they arrive so you don't even have to think about it while you're going about your day.

## Set Up

The only steps towards setting up this project locally is, after forking and cloning, run in terminal in the directory:

* npm install
* npm start

You will then be prompted to press a key based on which simulator you would like to run in. Press 'i', to run in iOS, as this has not been built out for android yet.
